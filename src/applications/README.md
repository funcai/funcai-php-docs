## Custom applications
When deciding which open source machine learning applications we're working on next, we're mostly thinking about what is helpful for a lot of different use cases. But FuncAI is build from the ground up to be easily extended, so it's quite easy to include your own models. Please get in touch if you'd like custom development or support from the creators of FuncAI.
